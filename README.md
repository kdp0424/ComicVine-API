# ComicVine-API
Collaborative project

This goal of this project is to create a website structured and styled using various markup and scripting languages that will incorporate dynamic features for user interaction. The website will incorporate a submittable search form that will provide custom results regarding graphic novel recommendations based on criteria specified by the user. The data will be pulled from an API provided by Comic Vine (CV), an online community and user-generated encyclopedia about comics.

The purpose of this project is to practice and build on web development, design, collaborative, and project management skills. Anything used from the CV API will be in accordance with their terms of use as stated on https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/ 

There are two collaborators on this repository, including a student.
